# Out of Hell Cafe

## Project Description
Welcome to **Out of Hell Cafe**, a unique web experience designed to immerse visitors in a dark, fiery, and aggressive ambiance, perfectly matching the cafe's brand. This project showcases a single-page website built purely with HTML and CSS, focusing on a strong thematic design, subtle animations, and an engaging user interface.

## Features
-   **Aggressive & Fiery Theme:** A dark color palette dominated by blacks and fiery reds/oranges, with glowing effects and sharp angles.
-   **Custom Typography:** Utilizes "Metal Mania" for headings to convey an intense, heavy metal aesthetic, complemented by "Roboto" for readability.
-   **Sticky Navigation Bar:** A top navigation bar that remains visible on scroll for easy section access.
-   **Dynamic Header:** Features a large, flickering title and a pulsing background effect to create an immersive first impression.
-   **Interactive Menu:** Menu items include a "peeking evil smiling chili" effect on hover, adding a unique and thematic touch. The chili image is now smaller and oval-shaped.

-   **Custom Scrollbar:** The browser scrollbar is styled to match the dark and fiery theme.
-   **Subtle Background Glow:** A faint, animated background glow adds to the "burning embers" feel, with increased visibility.
-   **Font Awesome Icons:** Social media links in the footer use Font Awesome icons for a professional look.
-   **Floating WhatsApp Button:** A convenient, floating button for direct WhatsApp contact.
